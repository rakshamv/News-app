        <h3>ABOUT ME</h3>
        <P>A news application is a big interactive database that tells a news story. Think of it like you would any other piece of journalism. It just uses software instead of words and pictures. By showing each reader data that is specific to them, a news
            app can help each reader understand a story in a way that’s personally meaningful to them. It can help a reader understand their personal connection to a broad national phenomenon, and help them attach what they know to what they don’t know,
            and thereby encourage a deep understanding of abstract concepts. We tend to build news apps when we have a dataset (or think we can acquire a dataset) that is national in scope yet granular enough to expose meaningful details. A news app should
            tell a story, and just like any good news story, it needs a headline, a byline, a lead, and a nut graph. Some of these concepts can be hard to distinguish in a piece of interactive software, but they’re there if you look closely. Also, a news
            app should be generative — meaning it should generate more stories and more reporting. ProPublica’s best apps have been used as the basis for local stories. For instance, take our Dollars for Docs news app. It tracked, for the first time,
            millions of dollars of payments by drug companies to doctors, for consulting, speaking, and so on. The news app we built lets readers look up their own doctor and see the payments they’ve received. Reporters at other news organizations also
            used the data. More than 125 local news organizations, including the Boston Globe, Chicago Tribune and the St. Louis Post-Dispatch did investigative stories on local doctors based on Dollars for Docs data. A few of these local stories were
            the result of formal partnerships, but the majority were done quite independently – in some cases, we didn’t have much if any knowledge that the story was being worked on until it came out. As a small but national news organization, this kind
            of thing is crucial for us. We can’t have local knowledge in 125 cities, but if our data can help reporters who have local knowledge tell stories with impact, we’re fulfilling our mission.
